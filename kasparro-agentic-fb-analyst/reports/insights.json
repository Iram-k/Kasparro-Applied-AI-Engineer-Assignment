## 🔟 Example `reports/insights.json`

You can generate and save once so it’s in the repo:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "insight_1",
    "title": "ROAS drop linked to CTR decline in key campaigns",
    "hypothesis": "ROAS decreased mainly because CTR fell for several high-spend campaigns while CPC increased, indicating creative fatigue.",
    "evidence": {
      "description": "ROAS trend shows lower ROAS in the later period; campaign summary indicates reduced CTR and higher CPC for top spenders.",
      "metrics_used": ["roas", "ctr", "cpc"]
    },
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "validated": true,
    "validation_details": {
      "rule": "confidence >= 0.6",
      "passed": true
    }
  }
]
